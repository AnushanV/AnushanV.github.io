The system was made in two separate teams. The first team consisted of 2 others and myself. The first team developed the front-end of the system in C++. The second team consisted of 1 other person and myself. The second team developed on the back-end of the system in Java.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Front-end</h3>\n<p>The front-end of the system was created in C++. This program allows users to perform actions by typing in different transaction codes. The actions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Login</li>\n<li>Register</li>\n<li>Add Credit</li>\n<li>List Item</li>\n<li>Place Bid</li>\n<li>Exit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a user enters these transaction codes, the program displays instructions for the users to carry out that transaction. For example, if the user types \"Login\" the program will display a prompt asking for their username and password. All transactions performed by the user are recorded in a text file called the transaction file.</p>\n<p>The front-end system was tested using shell scripts. The team created a several test cases for each possible transaction code, then compared the output of the program with a text file containing the expected output. Any differences were recorded, notifying the team if there were any mistakes made, and which case caused the mistake.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Back-end</h3>\n<p>The back-end of the system was created in Java and tested with JUnit. This program processes the transaction file created by the front-end. The back-end can make changes to the items file, and users file. If the transaction results in a change in the bid on an item, the back-end will update the item such that the highest bid is recorded. The back-end can also make changes to the credit belonging to a user by editing the users file.  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Project Status: Complete</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mock Auction System","tags":["C++","Java","JUnit","Shell Scripts"]},"excerpt":"The Mock Auction system is a text based system which allows users to simulate auctions.
